Network Noise Visual Indicator

## Description
This tiny project's purpose is to rise awareness in a fun and visual way about the levels of 'noise' that may be generated by many tools used during the preparation phase of a penetration test, like NMAP and WPscan (to name a few). The project consists of a Raspberry Pi while using its GPIO pins to drive a 20 LED matrix that will act some sort of network VU meters that will reflect with a relatively low latency what's going on through the wires.

The ideal Lab setup includes the attacker's computer, a target computer, an L2 managed switch and the Raspberry + LED Matrix. The managed switch can be configured to Mirror the target's traffic to the Raspberry Pi (using Port Mirroring) allowing us to observe the LEDs as the attacker tries network tools with its varying parameters, rising awareness that some of them are quite aggressive.


## Requirements
- One raspberry pi: In this case, a raspberry pi 3B+
- One pcb Board with 20 LEDs: This requires 4 GPIO PINs to select the Rows and 5 GPIO PINs to select the Columns.

### LED PCB Board.
WORK IN PROGRESS.
